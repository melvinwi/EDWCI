## Architecturally Significant Requirements

Includes, Critical Success Factors, Architectural Principles, Significant Functional Requirements, Significant Non-Functional Requirements, Significant Facts.


### Critical Success Factors

Data is emerging as a key enabler to the new energy services model. To respond effectively to the new services model, the architecture must support the following project critical success factors:

**CSF1** Managing information as an asset

**CSF2** Providing a business focus to information

**CSF3** Shared information will be registered and controlled

**CSF4** Information will be accurate and up to date

**CSF5** Ability to find and share information easily


### Architectural Principles

In support of building a strategic information asset for Lumo, the architecture must adhere to the following architectural principles.

**AP1** Systems of Record - Data to be sourced from authoritative data sources

**AP2** Scalability - The solution to be scalable to meet future data needs

**AP3** Agile - The environment and delivery must be able to stay ahead of the demand curve and easily adapt to changing business needs

**AP4** Integrated - Information is integrated where appropriate to provide a cohesive and consistent view of disparate data sources

**AP5** Timely - Information is provisioned to the business in a timely manner and the architecture can support near-real time requirements

**AP6** Private and Secure - The solution must adhere to privacy and security requirements

**AP7** Optimised for Data Warehousing - The information infrastructure must be reliable, scalable and flexible, to support a high data volume environment

**AP8** Business Strategic - Iterative development of the data warehouse is required, building common subject areas progressively and demonstrating business value frequently

**AP9** Foundational - As each additional phase is built, prior phases require minimal or no re-work and increasing scale of delivery does not reduce the pace of delivery. No rebuilds and minimal throw away

**AP10** Avoid Duplication - Do not duplicate business logic in various applications or layers

**AP11** Data integrity - Ensure integrity of data in all data processing and access scenarios



### Significant Functional Requirements

None


### Significant Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1. Audit - audit all access to personal information stored in the data warehouse

NFR2. Variable Data Currency - ensure data can enter the data warehouse at varying speeds based on business needs



### Significant Facts

None
