# Solution Architecture


### Overview

The energy industry is undergoing a fundamental shift both through the way energy is consumed and generated and through the way customers are acquired and managed through the lifecycle. The shift in energy consumption and sales, marketing and customer management activities is resulting in a significant variation in value between customer segments as the industry moves away from a generic commodity based revenue model and towards a sophisticated services model underpinned by advancing technology.

Data is emerging as a key enabler to the new energy services model through integrating technology such as embedded generation, storage and energy management and providing the insight necessary to acquire high value customers and develop a differentiated customer experience. To enable a response to the new services model requirements of the future it is critical that the business transform its data capability into a strategic function and provide the insight and functionality necessary to succeed going forward.

Lumo Energy has identified the need to have a clear view of the priorities that drive their business and to evaluate ways in which to use information to enhance business performance. Furthermore, Lumo has identified that its current BI architecture is not sustainable in the medium to long term and as a result of the growth and strategic plans the company is embarking upon, this BI framework and subsequent development will enhance this journey. This had led to the establishment of a Data Transformation program.

The purpose of the Lumo Data Transformation program is to – through Enterprise Information Management - deliver capabilities to enhance Lumo’s business performance.
